# USC-Research-Proj
This is my project that I did in the summer of 2024 under a Ph.D. Student at USC (ironic). It concerns the implementation of encoding techniques for models used in geographic/topological tasks to allow models to recognize more complex patterns, thus giving it better performance (VERY high-level/oversimplification).
